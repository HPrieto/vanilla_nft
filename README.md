## Compile Smart Contracts

```
truffle compile
```

## Testing Smart Contracts
```
truffle test ./test/AccessControl.sol
```

## Run the JavaScript Tests

```
truffle test ./test/AccessControl.js
```

## Migrating with Truffle Develop
To deploy our smart contracts, we're going to need to connect to a blockchain. Truffle has a built-in personal blockchain that can be used for testing. This blockchain is local to your system and does not interact with the main Ethereum network.

```
truffle develop
```
